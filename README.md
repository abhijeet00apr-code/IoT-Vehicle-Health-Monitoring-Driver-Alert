🚗 IoT Based Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System Using CAN and IoT

A comprehensive real-time embedded and IoT-based system designed to monitor vehicle health parameters and driver safety conditions using an automotive-grade CAN communication network and cloud-based alerting. The system enables real-time monitoring, fault detection, and proactive alerts for improved safety and reliability.

📋 Overview

This project designs and implements a real-time Vehicle Health Monitoring and Driver Alert System that continuously acquires data from multiple vehicle-related sensors, processes it locally using an embedded controller, and transmits it over the CAN bus. The processed data is displayed locally on a TFT display and remotely monitored using cloud services.

An event-based alert mechanism is implemented to notify users through email alerts whenever predefined safety thresholds are exceeded.
